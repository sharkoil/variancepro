## üìä Test Results

All 10 test queries were successfully translated and executed with 100% accuracy:

1. "Show me sales greater than 60000"
   - ‚úÖ SQL: `SELECT * FROM financial_data WHERE budget_sales > 60000 LIMIT 100`

2. "Find transactions where actual sales is less than budget sales"
   - ‚úÖ SQL: `SELECT * FROM financial_data WHERE actual_sales < budget_sales LIMIT 100`

3. "List products where discount percentage is greater than 2%"
   - ‚úÖ SQL: `SELECT * FROM financial_data WHERE discount_pct > 2 LIMIT 100`

4. "Show regions with customer satisfaction above 3"
   - ‚úÖ SQL: `SELECT * FROM financial_data WHERE customer_satisfaction > 3 GROUP BY region, customer_satisfaction LIMIT 100`

5. "Find transactions where sales variance is negative"
   - ‚úÖ SQL: `SELECT * FROM financial_data WHERE sales_variance < 0 LIMIT 100`

6. "Show me transactions with price variance greater than 3"
   - ‚úÖ SQL: `SELECT * FROM financial_data WHERE price_variance > 3 LIMIT 100`

7. "Total actual sales by region where budget sales is greater than 50000"
   - ‚úÖ SQL: `SELECT region, SUM(actual_sales) AS sum_actual_sales FROM financial_data WHERE budget_sales > 50000 GROUP BY region LIMIT 100`

8. "Average discount percentage by product line"
   - ‚úÖ SQL: `SELECT product_line, AVG(discount_pct) AS avg_discount_pct, COUNT(*) as count FROM financial_data GROUP BY product_line LIMIT 100`

9. "Top 5 regions by actual sales"
   - ‚úÖ SQL: `SELECT region, SUM(actual_sales) AS sum_actual_sales FROM financial_data GROUP BY region ORDER BY sum_actual_sales DESC LIMIT 5`

10. "Find products with highest customer satisfaction"
    - ‚úÖ SQL: `SELECT * FROM financial_data ORDER BY customer_satisfaction DESC LIMIT 100`

## üîß Technical Highlights

- **Pattern Recognition**: Complex regex patterns for financial terminology
- **Context Awareness**: Understanding of metrics and relationships
- **Confidence Scoring**: Detailed translation confidence metrics
- **Explanation Generation**: Clear explanations of generated SQL

## üìù Implementation Files

1. **Core Implementation**:
   - `analyzers/enhanced_nl_to_sql_translator_final_complete.py` - The main translator implementation

2. **Testing**:
   - `test_final_nl_to_sql_complete.py` - Comprehensive test script with 10 diverse queries

3. **Documentation**:
   - `docs/enhanced_nl_to_sql_translator_documentation.md` - Detailed implementation documentation

## üöÄ Usage Example

```python
# Import the translator
from analyzers.enhanced_nl_to_sql_translator_final_complete import EnhancedNLToSQLTranslator

# Initialize the translator
translator = EnhancedNLToSQLTranslator()

# Set the schema context
translator.set_schema_context(schema_info, "financial_data")

# Translate a query
result = translator.translate_to_sql("Show me top 5 regions by actual sales")

# Check if successful
if result.success:
    print(f"SQL: {result.sql_query}")
    print(f"Explanation: {result.explanation}")
    print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence}")
else:
    print(f"Error: {result.error_message}")
```
