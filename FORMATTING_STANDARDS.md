# Quant Commander - Analysis Formatting Standards

## Overview
This document outlines the standardized formatting system implemented across all analyzers and AI components in Quant Commander to ensure consistent, professional output with clear business focus.

## Core Principles

### 1. Business-First Communication
- All outputs use professional business language suitable for executives
- Technical jargon and statistical terminology are avoided
- Focus on actionable insights and business implications

### 2. No Code Policy
- **ZERO code snippets** in any user-facing output
- No SQL queries, Python syntax, or programming references
- No technical implementation details or data manipulation instructions

### 3. Clear Assumptions
- Every analysis explicitly states key assumptions
- Limitations and data quality issues are transparently communicated
- Analysis methodology is explained in business terms

### 4. Consistent Structure
- Standardized sections across all analysis types
- Professional formatting with banded tables for readability
- Clear hierarchy with headers, metrics, insights, and recommendations

## Implementation Details

### AnalysisFormatter Class
Located in: `analyzers/base_analyzer.py`

**Key Methods:**
- `create_summary_section()` - Standardized analysis headers with assumptions
- `create_banded_table()` - Professional tables with alternating row styling
- `create_insights_section()` - Structured insights and recommendations
- `create_metrics_grid()` - Key performance metrics display
- `format_currency()` - Consistent currency formatting ($1.2M, $850K)
- `format_percentage()` - Standard percentage display (12.5%)

### Standardized Analysis Output Structure

Each analysis follows this consistent format:

```
üìä **[ANALYSIS TYPE] ANALYSIS**
