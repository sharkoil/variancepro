# 🚀 StarCoder Integration - Enhanced Financial Analysis with Code

Your VariancePro app is now enhanced with **StarCoder**, a state-of-the-art code-focused language model that provides both financial analysis AND code suggestions for deeper data exploration.

## 🎯 Why StarCoder for Financial Analysis?

**StarCoder** excels at:
- 📊 **Data Analysis**: Understanding complex datasets and patterns
- 💻 **Code Generation**: Suggesting Python/pandas code for custom analysis
- 🔍 **Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex financial questions
- 📈 **Technical Insights**: Combining business logic with technical implementation

## 🛠️ Quick Setup

### Option 1: Automated Setup
```bash
python setup_llm.py
```
Choose option 1, then select StarCoder2 (recommended)

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Install Ollama (if not already installed)
# Download from: https://ollama.ai/download

# Pull StarCoder model
ollama pull starcoder2    # Recommended (7B params, faster)
# OR
ollama pull starcoder     # Original (15B params, more comprehensive)

# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# Restart your VariancePro app
```

## 🎪 StarCoder Enhanced Capabilities

### **Before StarCoder** (Basic Analysis):
```
User: "Analyze sales variance by region"
App: "North America has -2.3% variance, Europe has +1.8% variance..."
```

### **After StarCoder** (AI + Code Analysis):
```
User: "Analyze sales variance by region and suggest code for deeper analysis"

StarCoder Response:
📊 SALES VARIANCE ANALYSIS:
North America shows -2.3% variance driven by competitive pressure in Q1.
Europe outperforms with +1.8% variance due to successful product launches.

💻 CODE SUGGESTIONS FOR DEEPER ANALYSIS:
```python
# Group by region and calculate variance metrics
regional_analysis = df.groupby('region').agg({
    'sales_variance_pct': ['mean', 'std', 'min', 'max'],
    'actual_sales': 'sum',
    'business_event': lambda x: x.value_counts().to_dict()
})

# Correlation analysis
import seaborn as sns
correlation_matrix = df[['sales_variance_pct', 'actual_marketing', 
                        'customer_satisfaction', 'discount_pct']].corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True)
```

🎯 BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Investigate competitive pressure in North America
• Replicate Europe's successful product launch strategy
• Focus marketing spend on underperforming regions
```

## 🚀 Getting Started with StarCoder

1. **Upload Your Data**: Use the comprehensive sales dataset we generated
2. **Start Simple**: "Summarize my data and suggest analysis approaches"
3. **Get Specific**: "How can I analyze customer satisfaction impact on sales?"
4. **Request Code**: "Show me Python code to build this analysis"
5. **Iterate**: "Modify that code to include regional breakdowns"

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### StarCoder Shows "Offline"
```bash
# Check Ollama status
ollama list

# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# Pull StarCoder if not installed
ollama pull starcoder2
```

### Slow Response Times
- Use `starcoder2` instead of `starcoder` for faster responses
- Reduce data sample size for initial analysis
- Break complex questions into smaller parts

### Model Not Found
```bash
# Verify model installation
ollama list

# Pull if missing
ollama pull starcoder2
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**: "Analyze sales variance by region with statistical significance testing"
2. **Request Code**: "Show me the Python code to replicate this analysis"
3. **Iterate**: Build on previous responses for deeper insights
4. **Combine**: Ask for both business insights AND technical implementation
5. **Validate**: Use suggested code to verify and extend the analysis
