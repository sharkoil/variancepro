   - Created modular architecture with dedicated modules:
     - `core/app_core.py` - Application core logic
     - `core/ollama_connector.py` - LLM connectivity
     - `handlers/file_handler.py` - File upload handling
     - `handlers/chat_handler.py` - Chat message processing
     - `handlers/quick_action_handler.py` - Enhanced quick actions
     - `handlers/timestamp_handler.py` - Timestamp management
     - `analyzers/quant_analyzer.py` - Quantitative analysis

2. **✅ Enhanced Top N/Bottom N Analysis Implemented**
   - **LLM-Generated Commentary**: AI insights and business recommendations
   - **Multi-Timespan Variance Analysis**: Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly
   - **Advanced Statistical Analysis**: Mean, median, standard deviation, range, CV
   - **Outlier Detection**: IQR-based outlier identification
   - **Fallback Commentary**: Statistical analysis when LLM unavailable
   - **Performance Metrics**: Percentile rankings, percentage of total
   - **Aggregation Support**: Automatic grouping by categories

3. **✅ Robust Variance Analysis Tool Added**
   - Support for actual vs planned, budget vs sales, budget vs actuals
   - Multi-timespan comparison (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
   - Automatic variance pair detection
   - Comprehensive variance metrics (variance, CV, IQR)
   - Time-based variance tracking

4. **✅ High Test Coverage Maintained**
   - 28 unit and integration tests passing (100% pass rate)
   - Enhanced analysis functionality thoroughly tested
   - Error handling and edge cases covered
   - LLM integration and fallback testing

5. **✅ No Regression in Existing Functionality**
   - All original features preserved and working
