# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Integration

## Overview
The RAG integration enables Quant Commander to enhance its analysis with supplementary context from uploaded documents (PDFs and text files). This allows for more meaningful and contextual analysis that incorporates domain knowledge, reports, and additional insights.

## Features Added

### 📚 Document Upload & Management
- **New Documents Tab**: Upload PDFs or text files through a dedicated interface
- **Multi-file Support**: Upload multiple documents simultaneously
- **Document Management**: View uploaded documents, search through content, and clear when needed
- **File Types Supported**: PDF (.pdf) and text (.txt) files

### 🤖 Enhanced Analysis
All analysis types now automatically incorporate relevant document context when available:
- **Variance Analysis**: Enhanced with budget context, industry benchmarks, and recommendations from uploaded documents
- **Trend Analysis**: Augmented with market insights, seasonal patterns, and strategic context
- **Contribution Analysis**: Enriched with performance drivers and strategic priorities from documents

### 🔍 Smart Document Retrieval
- **Keyword-based Search**: Automatically finds relevant document sections for each analysis
- **Context-aware Enhancement**: Only includes relevant supplementary information
- **Graceful Fallback**: Works normally without documents, enhanced when available

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### RAGDocumentManager (`analyzers/rag_document_manager.py`)
- Handles PDF and text file upload and processing
- Chunks documents into searchable segments
- Provides keyword-based retrieval of relevant content
- Manages document lifecycle and session context

#### RAGEnhancedAnalyzer (`analyzers/rag_enhanced_analyzer.py`)
- Integrates with existing analyzers (variance, contributor, timescale)
- Enhances LLM prompts with retrieved document context
- Constructs comprehensive analysis incorporating both data and document insights
- Maintains quality with or without supplementary documents

### Integration Points

#### UI Integration (`app.py`)
- New "Documents" tab in the main interface
- Document upload, status tracking, and search functionality
- Seamless integration with existing analysis workflow

#### Analysis Coordinator (`analyzers/analysis_coordinator.py`)
- Modified to automatically use RAG enhancement when documents are available
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing analysis methods
- Intelligent routing between standard and enhanced analysis

## Usage

### 1. Upload Documents
1. Navigate to the "📚 Documents" tab
2. Click "Upload PDF or Text Files" and select your documents
3. Click "📤 Upload Documents" to process them
4. View upload status and document list

### 2. Enhanced Analysis
1. Upload your CSV data as usual in the "💬 Chat Analysis" tab
2. Perform any analysis (variance, trends, contribution)
3. If documents are uploaded, responses will automatically include relevant context
4. No changes needed to existing workflow - enhancement is transparent

### 3. Document Search
1. Use the search functionality in the Documents tab to find specific content
2. Enter keywords related to your analysis needs
3. Preview relevant document sections before analysis

## Example Workflow

```
1. Upload financial reports, industry benchmarks, or strategic documents
2. Upload your CSV data with budget/actual figures
3. Ask for "variance analysis" - get enhanced insights with:
   - Standard variance calculations
   - Industry context from uploaded documents
   - Strategic recommendations from reports
   - Historical patterns mentioned in documents
```

## Technical Details

### Requirements
- PyPDF2 >= 3.0.0 (for PDF processing)
- PyMuPDF >= 1.23.0 (enhanced PDF extraction)
- All existing VariancePro dependencies

### Performance
- Document chunking optimized for retrieval performance
- Lightweight keyword-based search for fast response times
- Async-ready architecture for future enhancements

### Data Privacy
- Documents processed locally only
- No external API calls for document processing
- Documents cleared when session ends or manually cleared

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Semantic Search**: Upgrade from keyword to embedding-based search
- **Document Summarization**: Auto-generate document summaries
- **Multi-format Support**: Excel, Word, PowerPoint documents
- **Document Versioning**: Track document updates and changes
- **Export with Context**: Include document context in exported reports

### Integration Opportunities
- **News Integration**: Combine RAG with existing news analysis
- **SQL Enhancement**: Use documents to improve natural language to SQL translation
- **Visualization Context**: Enhance charts with document insights

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- `tests/unit/test_rag_functionality.py`: Comprehensive RAG module testing
- Document upload, chunking, retrieval, and enhancement testing
- Integration workflow validation

### Demo
- `demo_rag_integration.py`: Standalone demo showing RAG capabilities
- Example document processing and enhancement

## Benefits

1. **Contextual Insights**: Analysis now considers broader business context
2. **Domain Knowledge**: Incorporate industry reports and strategic documents
3. **Improved Recommendations**: More actionable insights based on comprehensive information
4. **Seamless Integration**: No disruption to existing workflows
5. **Flexible Usage**: Works with or without supplementary documents

The RAG integration transforms Quant Commander from a data analysis tool into a comprehensive business intelligence platform that combines quantitative analysis with qualitative insights.
