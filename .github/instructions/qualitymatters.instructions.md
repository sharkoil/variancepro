NEVER LET A SINGLE FILE GET TOO LARGE.  If a file is getting too large, break it up into smaller files.  If a function is getting too large, break it up into smaller functions.  If a class is getting too large, break it up into smaller classes.  If a module is getting too large, break it up into smaller modules.

Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.

always put the tests in test folder. always use type hints.   always use descriptive function names.  always use consistent naming conventions.  always use modular design principles.  always write unit tests for all new code.  always include integration tests for major features.  always maintain test coverage above 80%.  always use descriptive test names.  always document code changes in the README.md file.

always add comments in each file so as a novice developer i can understand what is happening.
